Game Name: High Stakes War (or Custom Name)

Objective

The goal of the game is to maximize the sum of the cards collected by winning rounds through strategic bidding.

Setup

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Each player is assigned one suit (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣) consisting of 13 cards.

An additional suit (one of the remaining unused suits) is shuffled and placed face down as the auction deck.

The game is best suited for two to four players.


Gameplay

1. Revealing a Card

The top card from the auction deck is drawn and placed face-up in the center.



2. Bidding Phase

Each player secretly selects one card from their hand and places it face down as a bid.

Once all players have placed their cards, the bids are revealed simultaneously.




3. Determining the Winner

The player who bids the highest card value wins the auctioned card.

If there is a tie (same bid value), the earliest bidder (decided randomly or by previous turn order) wins.



4. Card Collection

The winning player takes the face-up card from the auction deck and adds it to their collection.

The bid cards used by all players are discarded and cannot be used again.



5. Next Round

The next card from the auction deck is revealed.

The bidding process repeats with the remaining cards in players' hands.



6. Game End

The game continues until all 13 rounds (one for each auction deck card) have been completed.

Each player adds up the values of the cards they have won.




Winning Condition

The player with the highest total sum of collected cards at the end of the game wins.


Strategy & Variations

Bluffing: Players may try to deceive opponents by making unpredictable bids.

Risk Management: Since each card can only be used once, players must decide when to use high-value cards strategically.

Multiplier Rounds (Optional): Certain rounds could offer double points to increase the stakes.

3-4 Player Mode: With more players, the auction becomes more unpredictable, requiring better hand management.
